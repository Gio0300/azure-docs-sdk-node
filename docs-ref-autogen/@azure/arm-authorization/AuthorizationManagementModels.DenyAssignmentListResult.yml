            Function used to determine the order of the elements. It is expected
            to return

            a negative value if the first argument is less than the second
            argument, zero if they're equal, and a positive

            value otherwise. If omitted, the elements are sorted in ascending,
            ASCII character order.

            [11,2,22,1].sort((a, b) => a - b)
