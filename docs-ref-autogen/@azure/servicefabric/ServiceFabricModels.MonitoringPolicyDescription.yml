      The compensating action to perform when a Monitored upgrade encounters
      monitoring policy or

      health policy violations.

      Invalid indicates the failure action is invalid. Rollback specifies that
      the upgrade will

      start rolling back automatically.

      Manual indicates that the upgrade will switch to UnmonitoredManual upgrade
      mode. Possible

      values include: 'Invalid', 'Rollback', 'Manual'

      The amount of time to retry health evaluation when the application or

      duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted as a number representing
      the total number of

      milliseconds.
