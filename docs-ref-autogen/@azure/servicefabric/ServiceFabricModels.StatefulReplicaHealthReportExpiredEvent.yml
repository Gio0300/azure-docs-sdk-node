      for the lifetime of the service. If the same service was deleted and
      recreated the IDs of its

      partitions would be different.

      of the replica. If a replica gets dropped and another replica gets created
      on the same node

      for the same partition, it will get a different value for the id.
      Sometimes the id of a

      stateless service instance is also referred as a replica id.
