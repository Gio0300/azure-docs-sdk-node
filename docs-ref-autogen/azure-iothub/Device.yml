### YamlMime:TSType
name: Device
uid: azure-iothub.Device
package: azure-iothub
summary: >-
  Creates a representation of a device for use with the [device identity
  registry](xref:azure-iothub.Registry) APIs.


  **This class is deprecated** because the [device identity
  registry](xref:azure-iothub.Registry) can work directly with JSON objects

  containing a partial description of the device, not necessarily the full
  object. On top of that initially this class was shipped with a typo

  on the `symmetricKey` property name (it was pascal-cased instead of
  camel-cased). The SDK is keeping this class around in order not to break
  existing code

  but this will be removed in a future major version update and customers should
  instead use plain JSON objects.

      Whether the device is 'connected' or 'disconnected'. It is not recommended
      to use this property to determine if the device is actually connected
      right now though,

      since the device connection may have timed out and the IoT hub may not
      have detected it, or if the device is using HTTPS to connect.

      If you have a need to monitor device connections, the recommended way is
      to use the [operations
      monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-operations-monitoring)
      feature of your hub.
