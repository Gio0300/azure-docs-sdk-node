      The set of actions the Personalizer service can pick from.

      The set should not contain more than 50 actions.

      The order of the actions does not affect the rank result but the order

      should match the sequence your application would have used to display
      them.

      The first item in the array will be used as Baseline item in Offline
      Evaluations.

      Features of the context used for Personalizer as a

      device, profile information, aggregated data about time and date, etc.
      Features should not include personally identifiable information (PII),
      unique UserIDs, or precise timestamps.

      Send false if it is certain the rewardActionId in rank results will be
      shown to the user, therefore

      Personalizer will expect a Reward call, otherwise it will assign the
      default

      Reward to the event. Send true if it is possible the user will not see the
      action specified in the rank results,

      (e.g. because the page is rendering later, or the Rank results may be
      overridden by code further downstream).

      You must call the Activate Event API if the event output is shown to
      users, otherwise Rewards will be ignored.

      If null, the service generates a unique eventId. The eventId will be used

      associating this request with its reward, as well as seeding the
      pseudo-random

      generator when making a Personalizer call.
