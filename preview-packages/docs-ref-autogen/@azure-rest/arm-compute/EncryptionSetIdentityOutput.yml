      The type of Managed Identity used by the DiskEncryptionSet. Only
      SystemAssigned is supported for new creations. Disk Encryption Sets can be
      updated with Identity type None during migration of subscription to a new
      Azure Active Directory tenant; it will cause the encrypted resources to
      lose access to the keys.
