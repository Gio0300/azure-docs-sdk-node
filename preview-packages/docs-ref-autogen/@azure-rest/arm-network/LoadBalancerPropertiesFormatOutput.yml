      Defines an external port range for inbound NAT to a single backend port on
      NICs associated with a load balancer. Inbound NAT rules are created
      automatically for each NIC associated with the Load Balancer using an
      external port from this range. Defining an Inbound NAT pool on your Load
      Balancer is mutually exclusive with defining inbound NAT rules. Inbound
      NAT pools are referenced from virtual machine scale sets. NICs that are
      associated with individual virtual machines cannot reference an inbound
      NAT pool. They have to reference individual inbound NAT rules.
