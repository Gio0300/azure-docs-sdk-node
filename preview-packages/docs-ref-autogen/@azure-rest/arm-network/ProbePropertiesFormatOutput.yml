    summary: >-
      The interval, in seconds, for how frequently to probe the endpoint for
      health status. Typically, the interval is slightly less than half the
      allocated timeout period (in seconds) which allows two full probes before
      taking the instance out of rotation. The default value is 15, the minimum
      value is 5.

      The number of probes where if no response, will result in stopping further

      to be taken out of rotation faster or slower than the typical times used
      in Azure.
