    summary: >-
      A human-readable message for the maneuver combined with the message from
      the next instruction. Sometimes it is possible to combine two successive
      instructions into a single instruction making it easier to follow. When
      this is the case the possibleCombineWithNext flag will be true. For
      example:


      ```

      10. Turn left onto Einsteinweg/A10/E22 towards Ring Amsterdam

      11. Follow Einsteinweg/A10/E22 towards Ring Amsterdam

      ```


      The possibleCombineWithNext flag on instruction 10 is true. This indicates
      to the clients of coded guidance that it can be combined with instruction
      11. The instructions will be combined automatically for clients requesting
      human-readable guidance. The combinedMessage field contains the combined
      message:


      ```

      Turn left onto Einsteinweg/A10/E22 towards Ring Amsterdam

      then follow Einsteinweg/A10/E22 towards Ring Amsterdam.
