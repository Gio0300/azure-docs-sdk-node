      **Get Polygon**



      **Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).


      The Get Polygon service allows you to request the geometry data such as a
      city or country  outline for a set of entities, previously retrieved from
      an Online Search request in GeoJSON format. The geometry ID is returned in
      the sourceGeometry object under "geometry" and "id" in either a Search
      Address or Search Fuzzy call.


      Please note that any geometry ID retrieved from an Online Search endpoint
      has a limited lifetime. The client  should not store geometry IDs in
      persistent storage for later referral, as the stability of these
      identifiers is  not guaranteed for a long period of time. It is expected
      that a request to the Polygon method is made within a  few minutes of the
      request to the Online Search method that provided the ID. The service
      allows for batch  requests up to 20 identifiers.
