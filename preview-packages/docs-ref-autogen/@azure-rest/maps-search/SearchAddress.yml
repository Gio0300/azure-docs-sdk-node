      **Address Geocoding**


      **Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).


      In many cases, the complete search service might be too much, for instance
      if you are only interested in traditional geocoding. Search can also be
      accessed for address look up exclusively. The geocoding is performed by
      hitting the geocode endpoint with just the address or partial address in
      question. The geocoding search index will be queried for everything above
      the street level data. No POIs will be returned. Note that the geocoder is
      very tolerant of typos and incomplete addresses. It will also handle
      everything from exact street addresses or street or intersections as well
      as higher level geographies such as city centers, counties, states etc.
