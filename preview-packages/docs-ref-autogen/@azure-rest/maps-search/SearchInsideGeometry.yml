      The Search Geometry endpoint allows you to perform a free form search
      inside a single geometry or many of them. The search results that fall
      inside the geometry/geometries will be returned.<br><br>To send the
      geometry you will use a `POST` request where the request body will contain
      the `geometry` object represented as a `GeoJSON` type and the
      `Content-Type` header will be set to `application/json`. The geographical
      features to be searched can be modeled as Polygon and/or Circle geometries
      represented using any one of the following `GeoJSON`
      types:<ul><li>**GeoJSON FeatureCollection** <br>The `geometry` can be
      represented as a `GeoJSON FeatureCollection` object. This is the
      recommended option if the geometry contains both Polygons and Circles. The
      `FeatureCollection` can contain a max of 50 `GeoJSON Feature` objects.
      Each `Feature` object should represent either a Polygon or a Circle with
      the following conditions:<ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>A `Feature`
      object for the Polygon geometry can have a max of 50 coordinates and it's
      properties must be empty.</li><li>A `Feature` object for the Circle
      geometry is composed of a _center_ represented using a `GeoJSON Point`
      type and a _radius_ value (in meters) which must be specified in the
      object's properties along with the _subType_ property whose value should
      be 'Circle'.</li></ul><br> Please see the Examples section below for a
      sample `FeatureCollection` representation.<br><br></li><li>**GeoJSON
      GeometryCollection**<br>The `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON
      GeometryCollection` object. This is the recommended option if the geometry
      contains a list of Polygons only. The `GeometryCollection` can contain a
      max of 50 `GeoJSON Polygon` objects. Each `Polygon` object can have a max
      of 50 coordinates. Please see the Examples section below for a sample
      `GeometryCollection` representation.<br><br></li><li>**GeoJSON
      Polygon**<br>The `geometry` can be represented as a `GeoJSON Polygon`
      object. This is the recommended option if the geometry contains a single
      Polygon. The `Polygon` object can have a max of 50 coordinates. Please see
      the Examples section below for a sample `Polygon`
      representation.<br><br></li></ul>.<br><br>
