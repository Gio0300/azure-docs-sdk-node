  **Get Polygon**



  **Applies to:** see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).


  The Get Polygon service allows you to request the geometry data such as a city
  or country  outline for a set of entities, previously retrieved from an Online
  Search request in GeoJSON format. The geometry ID is returned in the
  sourceGeometry object under "geometry" and "id" in either a Search Address or
  Search Fuzzy call.


  Please note that any geometry ID retrieved from an Online Search endpoint has
  a limited lifetime. The client  should not store geometry IDs in persistent
  storage for later referral, as the stability of these identifiers is  not
  guaranteed for a long period of time. It is expected that a request to the
  Polygon method is made within a  few minutes of the request to the Online
  Search method that provided the ID. The service allows for batch  requests up
  to 20 identifiers.
