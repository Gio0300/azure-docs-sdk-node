      Specifies the level of filtering performed on geographies. Narrows the
      search for specified geography entity types, e.g. return only
      municipality. The resulting response will contain the geography ID as well
      as the entity type matched. If you provide more than one entity as a comma
      separated list, endpoint will return the 'smallest entity available'.
      Returned Geometry ID can be used to get the geometry of that geography via
      [Get Search

      API. The following parameters are ignored when entityType is set:

      The View parameter (also called the "user region" parameter) allows you to
      show the correct maps for a certain country/region for geopolitically
      disputed regions. Different countries/regions have different views of such
      regions, and the View parameter allows your application to comply with the
      view required by the country/region your application will be serving. By
      default, the View parameter is set to “Unified” even if you haven’t
      defined it in  the request. It is your responsibility to determine the
      location of your users, and then set the View parameter correctly for that
      location. Alternatively, you have the option to set ‘View=Auto’, which
      will return the map data based on the IP  address of the request. The View
      parameter in Azure Maps must be used in compliance with applicable laws,
      including those  regarding mapping, of the country/region where maps,
      images and other data and third party content that you are authorized to 
      access via Azure Maps is made available. Example: view=IN.
