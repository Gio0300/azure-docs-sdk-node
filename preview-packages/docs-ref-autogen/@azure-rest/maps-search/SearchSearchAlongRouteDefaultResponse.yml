  The Search Along Route endpoint allows you to perform a fuzzy search for POIs
  along a specified route. This search is constrained by specifying the
  `maxDetourTime` limiting measure.<br><br>To send the route-points you will use
  a `POST` request where the request body will contain the `route` object
  represented as a `GeoJSON LineString` type and the `Content-Type` header will
  be set to `application/json`. Each route-point in `route` is represented as a
  `GeoJSON Position` type i.e. an array where the _longitude_ value is followed
  by the _latitude_ value and the _altitude_ value is ignored. The `route`
  should contain at least 2 route-points.<br><br>It is possible that original
  route will be altered, some of it's points may be skipped. If the route that
  passes through the found point is faster than the original one, the
  `detourTime` value in the response is negative.
