  [KnownNodeOSUpgradeChannel](xref:@azure/arm-containerservice.KnownNodeOSUpgradeChannel)
  can be used interchangeably with NodeOSUpgradeChannel,
   this enum contains the known values that the service supports.
  ### Known values supported by the service

  **None**: No attempt to update your machines OS will be made either by OS or
  by rolling VHDs. This means you are responsible for your security updates \

  **Unmanaged**: OS updates will be applied automatically through the OS
  built-in patching infrastructure. Newly scaled in machines will be unpatched
  initially, and will be patched at some later time by the OS's infrastructure.
  Behavior of this option depends on the OS in question. Ubuntu and Mariner
  apply security patches through unattended upgrade roughly once a day around
  06:00 UTC. Windows does not apply security patches automatically and so for
  them this option is equivalent to None till further notice \

  **SecurityPatch**: AKS will update the nodes VHD with patches from the image
  maintainer labelled "security only" on a regular basis. Where possible,
  patches will also be applied without reimaging to existing nodes. Some
  patches, such as kernel patches, cannot be applied to existing nodes without
  disruption. For such patches, the VHD will be updated, and machines will be
  rolling reimaged to that VHD following maintenance windows and surge settings.
  This option incurs the extra cost of hosting the VHDs in your node resource
  group. \

  **NodeImage**: AKS will update the nodes with a newly patched VHD containing
  security fixes and bugfixes on a weekly cadence. With the VHD update machines
  will be rolling reimaged to that VHD following maintenance windows and surge
  settings. No extra VHD cost is incurred when choosing this option as AKS hosts
  the images.
