    summary: >-
      The path from the location that the 'authentication' property [say, a SAS
      URI to the blob container] refers to, to the location of the artifacts.
      This can be used to differentiate different versions of the artifacts. Or,
      different types of artifacts like binaries or templates. The location
      referenced by the authentication property concatenated with this optional
      artifactRoot path forms the artifact source location where the artifacts
      are expected to be found.
