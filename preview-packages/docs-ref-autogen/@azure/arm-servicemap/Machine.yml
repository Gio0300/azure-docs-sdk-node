summary: >-
  A machine resource represents a discovered computer system. It can be
  *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on it, or *discovered*, i.e.,
  its existence was inferred by observing the data stream from monitored
  machines. As machines change, prior versions of the machine resource are
  preserved and available for access. A machine is live during an interval of
  time, if either its Dependency Agent has reported data during (parts) of that
  interval, or a Dependency agent running on other machines has reported
  activity associated with the machine.
