  A reference data set provides metadata about the events in an environment.
  Metadata in the reference data set will be joined with events as they are read
  from event sources. The metadata that makes up the reference data set is
  uploaded or modified through the Time Series Insights data plane APIs.

      The reference data set key comparison behavior can be set using this
      property. By default, the value is 'Ordinal' - which means case sensitive
      key comparison will be performed while joining reference data with events
      or while adding new reference data. When 'OrdinalIgnoreCase' is set, case
      insensitive comparison will be used.
