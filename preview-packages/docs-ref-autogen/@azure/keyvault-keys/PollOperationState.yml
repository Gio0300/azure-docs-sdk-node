  PollOperationState contains an opinionated list of the smallest set of
  properties needed

  to define any long running operation poller.


  While the Poller class works as the local control mechanism to start
  triggering, wait for,

  and potentially cancel a long running operation, the PollOperationState
  documents the status

  of the remote long running operation.


  It should be updated at least when the operation starts, when it's finished,
  and when it's cancelled.

  Though, implementations can have any other number of properties that can be
  updated by other reasons.
